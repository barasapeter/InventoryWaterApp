The system starts by launching a window that prompts for username and password. 
NOTE: The system uses MySQL as its primary DBMS. Upon launching MySQL database is created with two tables (IF NOT EXISTS):

1. The Merchants table `merchants` - Has two columns, `username` and `password`
2. The customer's table `customers` - Has four columns `username`, `password`, `account balance` and `notifications`
3. The Orders table `orders` - Has 11 columns that store `ORDER NO`, 'customer_username`, `merchant_username`, `bottle_id`, `description`, `price`, `date of order`, `time of order`, `delivery status`, `delivery date` and `time of delivery`


If a user does not have an account the interphase has a button that launches a toplevel window. The Window prompts the user to type in their username. Then a user is required to enter the password twice to make sure they match. I have created rules that govern password strength:
1. The password must be at least 8 characters long
2. The password must contain at least a number, lowercase letter, upperase letter and a special character

Another input required before signing up is the user type. There are two user types:
1. Merchant
2. Customer

An account is only created if:
1. All the fields have been entered at least a value.
2. The username entered does not exist in the union of existing merchant and customer usernames.
3. If the passwords match and they are strong.
Otherwise an error message is shown.

MERCHANTS
These are users who sell water. They refill bottles upon orders from customers. They can also refill bottles with cash money without pre-orders.

When a merchant creates an account, the following data is initialized:
a) merchant bottles table. this table stores bottle information such as bottle ID, bottle size, measurement unit and price/cost.
b) as sales table is created to store the sales data.

LOGGIN IN
As I mentioned earlier, the login interphase prompts username and password. The program checks if the username entered is in the database.

If the username is in the `merchants` table, Merchant Dashboard is displayed. Otherwise the Customer Dashboard is displayed.
dashboard will display only if the username entered corresponds with the password in the corresponding tables. Otherwise an error message is displayed 'Invalid username or password'.

CUSTOMER LOGIN
These users place their orders by choosing a merchant, and all the bottles the merchant has. The price for each bottle is displayed. The user chooses a bottle. The program checks if the user's bank account is enough for the bottle price and validates it. If the validation is successful an order is sent to the selected merchant.

MERCHANT LOGIN
A different interphase displays when a merchant logs in. A sidebar containing buttons "Sales History" (displays sales history), "Orders (n)" where n shows the number of new orders, "Receipts" (enables merchant to download receipts for each sale), "Dispensor" (launches a tab that has controls which initiate water dispensor), "My bottles" (which allows the user to add or delete bottles). 

When water is dispensed the data is recorderd. The dispense interphase allows the merchant to dispense as an order or not order. If water is dispensed as an order a notification is sent to the customer who placed the order and all the data is recorded in the "Orders table".
